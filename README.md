# Project Mesto remade with the help of React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Further steps
### Fix:
1. Add ability to delete created cards
2. Proper like/dislike function: for now works once, requires manual reload

### Kinda feats:
1. Close popups by Esc and a click outside the popup
2. Before deleting a card, a popup with delete confirmation pops up
3. Form validates and shows error as one types, not after submit
